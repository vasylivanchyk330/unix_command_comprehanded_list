This notebook consists of 3 parts:

1. command list -- comprehended list of commands that I have practiced. There is no strict command order.

2. draft notebooks -- a folder with shell files. Files contain scripts that I wrote for training.   

3. mini-projects -- a folder with script file projects that can be run as an independent program.
