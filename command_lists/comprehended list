---------------------------------------------- Unix. basic theory

Types of UNIX: Sun Solaris, GNU/Linux, and MacOS X
three parts: the kernel, the shell and the programs, its relation
	Shell – computer interface, expose the OS services to human user or other programs,
	    takes commands and give them to the OS to perform.
	    it around OS like a shell around an oyster.
	kernel – operates, eg removes it
    Programs – commands used, eg rm
    +
    terminal - a program that runs a shell
Shell – CLI
    interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried out
--
Bash
    on most Linux-based systems the default shell program.
--
certain features
	Filename Completion
    History
--
Everything in UNIX is either a file or a process
    A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process 	i	identifier)
--
inverted tree directory structure
--
GNU
    is a collection of free UNIX-based software, which can be used as an operating system
    or can be used in parts with other operating systems.
    The use of the completed GNU tools led to the family of operating systems popularly known as Linux.
    Most of GNU is licensed under the GNU Project.

--------------------------------------- basic Unix commands:

cd
cd ~        # get to a user folder -- pwd outcome /home/user
cd /        # get to the root  -- the top level folder -- pwd outcome /
cd ~/Desktop
P:
p:
| -- use the previous output as an input

chmod 777 filename.frm 	(777 -- rwxrwxrwx)

whoami
xdg-open .      # open a wd
mkdir
mkdir folder1
mkdir folder1 folder2
mkdir folder1/folder3
mkdir -p test_l1/test_l2/test_l3  #    --parents; create folder_l3 even if no folder_l2
pwd         # print working directory
help a_command
man a_command 		# manual, like as help
ftp         #
head file -10   # default -10
tail file -10
tail -f file    # automatically updates the output; never goes back to the $ == to go out use cntr+C
clear

less file       # print out by pages
                # enable search
                # G -- to get to the file end, q -- to quit
